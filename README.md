> Everything is stuck together. People are stuck together. They can't change. Ideas are stuck together - they're irrevocable. We think that the end of the universe is as far as the telescope can see. — **Frederick Lenz**

Hello, I am a very nutricious and delicious drink called **Kefir**[^1]! Though my name is Kefirka... nevermind. Just in case, if you have any suggestion for me or found a bug, you can contact the developer directly or through support server called **The Web Realm**!
In any case, I am here to:
