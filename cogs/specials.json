Whenever she cannnot reach something she uses her tail to become taller to reach but if that does not work she'll get frustrated and get some stairs. She has intrusive thoughts of eating, biting and touching anything. She likes to scare other cats by holding a knife as a joke she would not actually stab someone unless she despises you."
